# ðŸš‡ MVV Train Data Analysis 

**Reverse-engineering, querying, and visualizing public transit dataâ€”for a fun powerpoint karaoke evening with friends**

This project involves reverse-engineering the API of a public transit app to collect monthsâ€™ worth of train data for the **MVV Munich network** (S-Bahn and U-Bahn). The collected data was then analyzed and visualized in various graphs and charts, which are available in a linked PDF.

The project was originally created as a quirky and data-driven contribution to a **PowerPoint Karaoke** evening with friends. Check out the slides if you want, but I cannot provide the code since the MVV explicitly does not want people to play around with their data, so I won't instigate people to do so with ease by copying my project :D

## ðŸ“Š Results

The visualizations include:
- Peak train activity times across different lines.
- Delays and their frequency patterns.
- A breakdown of S-Bahn traffic, U-Bahn has to be evaluated yet, but the data exists

## ðŸŽ¤ PowerPoint Karaoke

The project was initially conceived for a **PowerPoint Karaoke evening**, where each participant presents slides theyâ€™ve never seen before.
